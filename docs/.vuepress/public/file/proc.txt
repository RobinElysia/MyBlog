NAME
       proc - process information, system information, and sysctl pseudo-filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       The  proc  filesystem  is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures.  It is com‐
       monly mounted at /proc.  Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be mounted  manu‐
       ally using a command such as:

           mount -t proc proc /proc

       Most  of  the files in the proc filesystem are read-only, but some files are writable, allowing kernel variables
       to be changed.

   Mount options
       The proc filesystem supports the following mount options:

       hidepid=n (since Linux 3.3)
              This option controls who can access the information in /proc/pid directories.  The argument, n, is one of
              the following values:

              0   Everybody may access all /proc/pid directories.  This is the traditional behavior, and the default if
                  this mount option is not specified.

              1   Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any /proc/pid directories  but  their  own  (the
                  /proc/pid  directories  themselves  remain  visible).   Sensitive files such as /proc/pid/cmdline and
                  /proc/pid/status are now protected against other users.  This makes it impossible  to  learn  whether
                  any user is running a specific program (so long as the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its
                  behavior).

              2   As  for  mode 1, but in addition the /proc/pid directories belonging to other users become invisible.
                  This means that /proc/pid entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs  on  the  system.   This
                  doesn't  hide  the  fact  that a process with a specific PID value exists (it can be learned by other
                  means, for example, by "kill -0 $PID"), but it hides a process's UID and GID, which  could  otherwise
                  be  learned  by  employing  stat(2) on a /proc/pid directory.  This greatly complicates an attacker's
                  task of gathering information about running processes (e.g., discovering whether some daemon is  run‐
                  ning  with elevated privileges, whether another user is running some sensitive program, whether other
                  users are running any program at all, and so on).

              gid=gid (since Linux 3.3)
                  Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to learn process information otherwise  pro‐
                  hibited  by  hidepid  (i.e.,  users in this group behave as though /proc was mounted with hidepid=0).
                  This group should be used instead of approaches such as putting nonroot  users  into  the  sudoers(5)
                  file.

       subset=pid (since Linux 5.8)
              Show  only  the specified subset of procfs, hiding all top level files and directories in the procfs that
              are not related to tasks.

   Overview
       Underneath /proc, there are the following general groups of files and subdirectories:

       /proc/pid subdirectories
              Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing information about the process
              with the corresponding process ID.

              Underneath each of the /proc/pid directories, a task subdirectory contains  subdirectories  of  the  form
              task/tid,  which contain corresponding information about each of the threads in the process, where tid is
              the kernel thread ID of the thread.

              The /proc/pid subdirectories are visible when iterating through /proc with getdents(2) (and thus are vis‐
              ible when one uses ls(1) to view the contents of /proc).

       /proc/tid subdirectories
              Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing information about the  thread
              with  the  corresponding  thread ID.  The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding
              /proc/pid/task/tid directories.

              The /proc/tid subdirectories are not visible when iterating through /proc with getdents(2) (and thus  are
              not visible when one uses ls(1) to view the contents of /proc).

       /proc/self
              When a process accesses this magic symbolic link, it resolves to the process's own /proc/pid directory.

       /proc/thread-self
              When a thread accesses this magic symbolic link, it resolves to the process's own /proc/self/task/tid di‐
              rectory.

       /proc/[a-z]*
              Various other files and subdirectories under /proc expose system-wide information.

       All of the above are described in more detail in separate manpages whose names start with proc_.

NOTES
       Many  files  contain strings (e.g., the environment and command line) that are in the internal format, with sub‐
       fields terminated by null bytes ('\0').  When inspecting such files, you may find  that  the  results  are  more
       readable if you use a command of the following form to display them:

           $ cat file | tr '\000' '\n'
